# Heart-Disease-Classification
<h3>Dataset used: Heart Disease Dataset <href>https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/johnsmith88/heart-disease-dataset</href> </h3>

<p>This projects aims to classify whether a patient has heart disease or not based on various features like </p>
<ol>
<li>chest pain type </li>
<li>resting blood pressure</li>
<li>fasting blood sugar > 120 mg/dl</li>
<li>resting electrocardiographic results (values 0,1,2)</li>
<li>maximum heart rate achieved</li>
<li>exercise induced angina</li>
<li>oldpeak = ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest</li>
<li>the slope of the peak exercise ST segment</li>
<li>number of major vessels (0-3) colored by flourosopy</li>
<li>number of major vessels (0-3) colored by flourosopy</li>
<li>thal: 0 = normal; 1 = fixed defect; 2 = reversable defect</li>
</ol>
<p>Models used: Support Vector Machine,Decision Tree and Random Forest</p>
<p>All the models were trained with and without Bagging Technique</p>
<p><b>Hence Decision Tree with bagging technique gives the highest accuracy of 86.5%</b></p>
